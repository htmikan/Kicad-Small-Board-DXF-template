# KiCad Small Board DXF Template

## Discription

When creating a PCB using KiCad, a PCB outline drawing is required.\
KiCad can create a simple rectangular board. However, if you need screw holes at specified dimensions or rounded corners, you must use separate CAD software for drafting.\
Here, we've created a template tailored for the most affordable PCB manufacturers in China, specifically for sizes up to 100x100mm, making it easy to use.

## How to use

Open the PCB Editor. Select File > Import > Graphics to display the popup.\
Locate and select this DXF file from your files.\
Verify the layer is set to **Edge.Cuts**, then click the OK button to import it.\
